Game Engine
===========
This engine will be a library that is usable by anyone, so please document the 
functions you create in the h-files so that we can use doxygen, or a similar program later.


How to add new sourcefiles
--------------------------
Since I decided we should use autoconf and automake to make our lives easier.
I've gone ahead and incorporated all the scripts necessary to use them. 

To add a new file to the buildscript, open src/Makefile.am
in there, you will find a variable named libgameengine_la_SOURCES, 
this is a list of all sourcefiles that should be available in the library.

There is also en enginetest_SOURCES, this is to create an executable testsuite 
for the library, please do not touch this unless you have a good reason. 
To add a test file to the testsuite, please add the h-file to the test_sources variable.

When you are finished save and close Makefile.am and proceed to run bootstrap, 
this will generate the new Makefile which you then can use in the compilation.
