Game Engine
===========
This engine will be a library that is usable by anyone, so please document the 
functions you create in the h-files so that we can use doxygen, or a similar program later.


How to add new sourcefiles
--------------------------
Since I decided we should use autoconf and automake to make our lives easier.
I've gone ahead and incorporated all the scripts necessary to use them. 

To add a new file to the buildscript, open src/Makefile.am
in there, you will find a variable named libgameengine_la_SOURCES, 
this is a list of all sourcefiles that should be available in the library.

There is also en enginetest_SOURCES, this is to create an executable testsuite 
for the library, please do not touch this unless you have a good reason. 
To add a test file to the testsuite, please add the h-file to the test_sources variable.

When you are finished save and close Makefile.am and proceed to run bootstrap, 
this will generate the new Makefile which you then can use in the compilation.


How to compile
--------------
$ make
# make install

Dependencies
------------
libsdl1.2
libsdl-ttf2.0
libsdl-image1.2
cxxtest (if enable-test)

How to install cxxtest on windows
---------------------------------
Step 1: Installing Perl or Python

After installation, make sure that Python or Perl is in your path.

Step 2: Installing CxxTest

Download CxxTest from its home page. This example will unzip the file to C:\. After unzipping, add your directory to the PATH and to the INCLUDE environment variables. Here is how to do it in Vista/7:

    Click Start menu, click “Control Panel” from the right column to start the control panel
    From the control panel’s search box, type ‘env’ and you will see the choice for “Edit environment variables for you account”, click it.
    If the environment PATH does not exist, create it and assign the value C:\CxxTest (or the location of your CxxTest directory). If the PATH evironment already exist, append ;C:\CxxTest to it (note the semicolon which acts as a separator).
    Similarly, add C:\CxxTest to the INCLUDE variable
    Click OK to submit your changes
