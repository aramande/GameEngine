Game Engine
===========
This engine will be a library that is usable by anyone, so please document the 
functions you create in the h-files so that we can use doxygen, or a similar program later.


How to add new sourcefiles
--------------------------
To add a new file to the buildscript, open src/CMakeLists.txt
in there, you will find add_library, this is a list of all sourcefiles that 
should be available in the library.

To add a test file to the testsuite, simply add the h-file to the test_headers variable.

To add a file to the game, add it to the add_executable list, and it will be 
compiled into the gametest executable.

Compile everything and don't forget to execute the enginetest to run all unittests.


How to compile
--------------
$ cmake .
$ make
# make install

Change cmake generator
----------------------
The choices of generator depends on platform. To find out what generators are available to you
   $ cmake --help
Then simply choose your generator and compile with it.
   $ cmake -G "Visual Studio 10" .

Dependencies
------------
libsdl1.2
libsdl-ttf2.0
libsdl-image1.2

How to install cxxtest (windows)
---------------------------------
Step 1: Installing Perl or Python

After installation, make sure that Python or Perl is in your path.

Step 2: Installing CxxTest

Download CxxTest from http://cxxtest.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList. This example 
will unzip the file to C:\. After unzipping, add your directory to the PATH and to the INCLUDE 
environment variables. Here is how to do it in Vista/7:

    Click Start menu, click 'Control Panel' from the right column to start the control panel
    From the control panel's search box, type 'env' and you will see the choice for 
    'Edit environment variables for you account', click it.
    
    If the environment PATH does not exist, create it and assign the value C:\CxxTest 
    (or the location of your CxxTest directory). If the PATH evironment already exist, 
    append ;C:\CxxTest to it (note the semicolon which acts as a separator).
    
    Similarly, add C:\CxxTest to the INCLUDE variable
    Click OK to submit your changes

How to install cxxtest (*nix)
-----------------------------
Get the source  http://cxxtest.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList.
Extract it to e.g. /tmp via

    tar xzf cxxtest-3.10.1.tar.gz

Move the whole cxxtest directory with all files to /usr/local/

    mv cxxtest /usr/local

Symlink the executable cxxtestgen.py to /usr/local/bin/

    cd /usr/local/bin && ln -s ../cxxtest/cxxtestgen.py

Symlink the header directory (cxxtest) to /usr/local/includes/

    cd /usr/local/include && ln -s ../cxxtest/cxxtest
